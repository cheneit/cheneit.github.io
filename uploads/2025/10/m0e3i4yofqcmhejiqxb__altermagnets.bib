  abstract = {Motivated by the orientation-dependent properties of d-wave superconductors (SCs), we investigate Andreev bound states (ABSs) and Josephson current in s-wave SC/altermagnet/d-wave SC (S/AM/D) and d-wave SC/altermagnet/d-wave SC (D/AM/D) junctions. The asymmetric S/AM/D junction exhibits a node-less ABSs spectrum with distinct spin states, arising from AM manipulation. In contrast, a symmetric D/AM/D junction with \${\textbackslash}pm 45{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$-oriented order parameters exhibits a nodal ABSs spectrum, characterized by spin-split sinusoidal curves. This behavior arises from the angular dependence of the d-wave pairing potential, which introduces a \${\textbackslash}pi\$-shift in the ABSs spectrum of the D/AM/D junction compared to that of conventional S/AM/S junctions. Additionally, the positions of the ABSs nodes in the D/AM/D junction can be controlled by adjusting the length and strength of the AM layer. Analysis of the free energy and Josephson current reveals additional extrema in the free energy at intermediate phase differences, leading to skewness and a non-sinusoidal behavior in the current-phase relationship of both configurations. These zero-supercurrent phase differences can be tuned by adjusting the properties of the AM layer such as AM strength and length. These findings provide new insights into AM-based Josephson junctions.},

In this Letter, we show that under an alternating spin-polarized current with polarization along the AFM anisotropy axis, an AFM DW can be excited to precess. Especially, chaotic precession occurs at a moderate interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which contributes to a nonlinear term in the dynamic equation of DW precession. Crisis-induced intermittent chaos appears when the current density is higher than a critical value. This Letter not only paves a way to unravel the rich dynamics of a current-induced AFM texture but also provides guidelines for developing ultrafast spintronic devices to exploit the nonlinear chaotic magnetization dynamics with promising applications.},

However, experimental methods for probing the \$k\$-space spin polarization in altermagnets remain limited. In this work, we propose an approach to address this challenge by interfacing an altermagnet with the surface of a topological insulator. The massless Dirac fermions on the topological insulator surface acquire a mass due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking. The local \$k\$-space magnetic moment at the Dirac point directly determines both the sign and magnitude of this Dirac mass, resulting in an anomalous Hall effect. By measuring the Hall conductance, we can extract the local \$k\$-space magnetic moment. Moreover, we can map the global magnetic moment distribution by tuning the Dirac point position using an in-plane magnetic field, thereby revealing the \$k\$-space spin density of the altermagnet. This work establishes the Dirac fermion on the topological insulator surface as a sensitive probe for unveiling spin characters of altermagnets and those of other unconventional antiferromagnets.},

Here, we provide an analytical description of the reflection and transmission coefficients of polaritons under oblique incidence, establishing a Fresnel formula tailored to polaritons. We demonstrate that boundary-scattered fields, whether evanescent or radiative, couple with polaritons, inducing phase shifts in reflected and transmitted polaritons and changing the momentum of polaritons in a direction perpendicular to the boundary by an imaginary amount. These polariton dynamics at the boundary lead to various features, including a Brewster-like effect, the Goos-H{\"a}nchen effect without total internal reflection, and the cross-polarization coupling of polaritons. Our analytical understanding of polariton dynamics could be applied to the development of future polaritonic devices utilizing 2D materials.},

We investigate the planar Hall effect in two-dimensional higher symmetric X-wave magnets with X=p,d,f,g,i, where those with X=d,g,i are altermagnets. The X-wave magnet is characterized by the number N\textsubscript{X} of the nodes in the band structure, where N\textsubscript{X}=1,2,3,4,6 corresponding to X=p,d,f,g,i.

Building on these distinct electronic structures, we propose all-electrically controlled spin filter and spin valve devices, where quantum resonant tunneling enables highly spin-polarized conductance tunable via gate voltage and interface transparency. In particular, we find that strong altermagnets allow gate-tunable full spin polarization that is robust against interface scattering and can be reversed by gate control. We further demonstrate that a double-gated spin valve electrically switches between parallel and antiparallel spin configurations, analogous to magnetic junctions but without the need for external magnetic fields. Our results establish both weak and strong altermagnets as promising platforms for realizing magnetic-field-free electrically tunable spintronic functionalities.},

  abstract = {Superconducting altermagnets have proven to be a promising ground for emergent phenomena but their study has involved two dimensional systems. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional \$d\$- and \$g\$-wave altermagnets with chiral \$d\$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface flat bands due to the underlying symmetries. We find that these crossed flat bands appear at zero energy in the surface along \$z\$ due to the superconducting nodal lines in the \$xy\$-plane, while the number of corners is determined by the crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance of zero-energy arcs in the surface along \$x\$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the crossed surface flat bands, surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give rise to distinct signals in charge conductance, hence offering a solid way for their detection and paving the way for realizing higher dimensional topological phases using altermagnets.},

In the strong AM regime, the charge conductivity vanishes as \${\textbackslash}theta {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}pi\$, while in the weak AM phase it remains finite. Introducing a normal metal between two AMs leads to Fabry-P{\textbackslash}'erot-type oscillations in charge conductivity. In the strong phase, transport is dominated by up-spin electrons, whereas both spin channels contribute in the weak phase.

Focusing on the prototypical d-wave altermagnets, e.g., RuO               2               , we can explain intuitively the characteristic lifted degeneracy of their magnon spectra, by the emergence of an effective sublattice-dependent anisotropic spin stiffness arising naturally from the phenomenological theory. We show that as a consequence the altermagnetic domain walls, in contrast to antiferromagnets, have a finite gradient of the magnetization, with its strength and gradient direction connected to the altermagnetic anisotropy, even for 180{$^\circ$} domain walls. This gradient generates a ponderomotive force in the domain wall in the presence of a strongly inhomogeneous external magnetic field, which may be achieved through magnetic force microscopy techniques. The motion of these altermagentic domain walls is also characterized by an anisotropic Walker breakdown, with much higher speed limits of propagation than ferromagnets but lower than antiferromagnets.},

Direct observation of the characteristic altermagnetic spin splitting, however, remains challenging. Indirect signatures can be obtained via transport studies, which so far have only considered homogeneous fields driving currents. We propose to leverage nonuniform electric fields and spin density gradients to probe the shape and the spin polarization of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces via transport measurements. By using both a semiclassical Boltzmann approach and a lattice Keldysh formalism, we show that altermagnets excite swirling electric and spin currents whose profiles depend on the relative orientation of altermagnetic lobes with respect to the sample boundaries. These currents can be measured via magnetometry techniques. Unlike previous proposals considering the hydrodynamic regime of transport, swirling currents are observed even in the Ohmic regime and rely exclusively on the altermagnetic spin splitting, with no swirls observed in ferromagnets. The electric and spin current vortices predicted here provide a unique altermagnetic signature in an experimentally accessible setup.},

Using a tight-binding lattice model for altermagnets and the Holstein model for the phonon sector, we find that the electron-phonon scatterings can strongly increase the spin conductivity at finite frequencies. This occurs despite the fact that the self-energy describing the electron-phonon interactions is spin-independent. Interestingly, we show that electron-phonon scattering also enhances the spin-splitter effect at finite frequencies.

Here, we show that chiral antiferromagnetism, with non-relativistic spin-split bands and distinctive valley-locked spin texture, can instead significantly enhance Josephson supercurrents. This enhancement stems from the emergence of dominant equal-spin triplet pairing and strong fluctuations of singlet pairing in momentum space, both induced by chiral antiferromagnetism. We demonstrate these results in Josephson junctions composed of chiral antiferromagnetic metals and conventional superconductors on kagome lattices. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced Josephson supercurrent is stabilized in a \${\textbackslash}pi\$-junction state. These phenomena persist across a broad energy range and remain stable for different temperatures and junction lengths. Our results unveil a previously unexplored mechanism for enhancing supercurrent by strong magnetic order and provide crucial insights into the large Josephson currents observed in Mn\$\_3\$Ge.},

  abstract = {Altermagnetism is a collinear compensated magnetically-ordered phase with a d, g or i-wave anisotropy and alternating spin polarization of the electronic structure in the position and momentum space. Its recent discovery was in part motivated by the research of compensated magnets towards highly scalable spintronic technologies. Simultaneously, altermagnetism shares the anisotropic higher-partial-wave nature of ordering with unconventional superfluid phases which have been at the forefront of research for the past several decades. These examples illustrate the interest in altermagnetism from a broad range of science and technology perspectives. After summarizing the diverse research context, we turn the focus of this review to the symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism. We start from the description of spontaneously broken and retained symmetries which delineate the compensated altermagnetic ordering as a distinct magnetic phase. Next we focus on microscopic signatures and ordering mechanism of the altermagnetic phase. We highlight crystal-structure realizations of a characteristic ferroic order of anisotropic higher-partial-wave components of atomic-scale spin densities in altermagnets, ranging from weakly-interacting metals to strongly correlated insulators. The symmetry and microscopy signatures of altermagnetism are directly reflected in spin-dependent electronic spectra and responses. We review salient band-structure features originating from the altermagnetic ordering, and from its interplay with spin-orbit coupling and topological phenomena. Throughout the review we compare altermagnetism to traditional ferromagnetism and Neel antiferromagntism, and to the currently intensely explored magnetic phases with non-collinear symmetry-protected compensated spin orders. We accompany the theoretical discussions by references to relevant experiments.},

  abstract = {Order parameters not only characterize symmetry-broken equilibrium phases but also govern transport phenomena in the nonequilibrium regime. Altermagnets, a class of magnetic systems integrating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic features, host multipolar orders in addition to dipolar Neel order. In this work, we demonstrate the multipole Hall effect in d-wave altermagnets--a transverse flow of multipole moments induced by an electric field. Using symmetry analysis and linear response theory, we show that the magnetic octupole Hall effect persists even in symmetries where the spin-splitter effect is forbidden and thus provides a robust experimental signature. In addition, we identify a sizable electric quadrupole Hall effect, originating from quadrupole splittings in the band structure. Our results expand the family of Hall effects to include higher-order multipolar responses and establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for exploring multipole transport beyond spin and orbital degrees of freedom.},

They share with conventional antiferromagnets the feature of a vanishing net magnetization. At the same time they show a spin-splitting of electronic bands, just as in ferromagnets, caused by the atomic exchange interaction. On the other hand, topology has recently revolutionized our understanding of condensed matter physics, introducing new phases of matter classified by intrinsic topological order. Here we connect the worlds of altermagnetism and topology, showing that the electronic structure of the altermagnet CrSb is topological. Using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe the large momentum-dependent spin-splitting in CrSb that induces altermagnetic Weyl nodes. We observe the related topological Fermi-arcs, which in electronic structure calculations are spin polarized. This indicates that in altermagnets the large energy scale intrinsic to their spin-splitting creates its own realm of robust electronic topology.},

  abstract = {This article explores the deep interconnections among three seemingly unrelated concepts in condensed matter physics: electronic liquid crystal phases, multipole expansions, and altermagnetism. At the heart of these phenomena lies a shared foundation: spin-momentum locking in the nonrelativistic regime. Originally proposed in the context of electronic liquid crystal phases, spin-momentum locking was later elegantly incorporated into the formalism of multipole expansions. This framework can be further extended across multiple atomic sites, making it particularly effective for describing altermagnets, which feature localized magnetic moments distributed over at least two sublattices. In the second part of the article, we examine superconducting phenomena that stem from this shared mechanism, focusing on superconductivity in systems with spin-momentum locked Fermi surfaces. We highlight a rich variety of unconventional superconducting states, including finite-momentum pairing, \$d\$-wave and spin-triplet superconductivity, and topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, among others. Additional related topics are addressed in the concluding section. Overall, this work offers both an accessible introduction to the newly identified magnetic order known as altermagnetism and a conceptual guide for researchers aiming to harness the ensuing unconventional superconductivity in the development of future quantum technologies.},

In particular, we focus on spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductors under the influence of \$d\$-wave altermagnets and \$p\$-wave magnets. Under generic conditions, we find that unconventional magnets not only drive a spin-singlet to spin-triplet conversion but also they transfer their parity symmetry that induces superconducting correlations with higher angular momentum. For instance, a conventional spin-singlet \$s\$-wave superconductor with \$d\$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet \$d\$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with \$p\$-wave magnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed spin-triplet \$p\$-wave symmetry. We further demonstrate that unconventional magnetism produces even more exotic superconducting correlations in spin-singlet \$d\$-wave superconductors, where odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet \$g\$-wave and even-frequency mixed spin-triplet \$f\$-wave pair symmetries are possible in altermagnets and \$p\$-wave magnets, respectively. We also discuss how these ideas generalize to spin-triplet \$p\$-wave superconductors and also show how our results can be applied to unconventional magnets with higher angular momentum, such as \$f\$-, \$g\$-, and \$i\$-wave.

This amplitude has a hysteresis vs. frequency sweeping direction. Our result showed that this phenomenon was due to a Duffing-type nonlinear resonance. Consequently, the amplitude enhancement reduced the vortex core-switching magnetic field to well below 10\>mT. A theoretical model corresponding to the Duffing oscillator was developed from the Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation to explore the physical origin of the simulation result.

In the presence of combined four-fold rotation and time-reversal (\$C\_4{\textbackslash}mathcal\{T\}\$) symmetry, linear and also second-order, driven by a Berry curvature dipole, anomalous Hall responses are forbidden in any pure \$d\$-wave altermagnet. Nevertheless, here we find that the nontrivial quantum metric of the occupied Bloch states allows for an electric field induced Berry curvature dipole, which generates a strong and tunable second-order Hall current, enabling it to be switched on or off by simply adjusting the relative orientation between the symmetry-reducing dc field and the ac probe field. Specifically, we investigate the electric field induced second-order anomalous Hall response in a two-dimensional Rashba-coupled hybrid altermagnet that interpolates between \$d\_\{x{\textasciicircum}2-y{\textasciicircum}2\}\$ (\$B\_\{1g\}\$) and \$d\_\{xy\}\$ (\$B\_\{2g\}\$) altermagnet symmetry, motivated by recent proposals for mixed-symmetry states. Crucially, the nonlinear signal is highly sensitive to the underlying symmetry of the altermagnetic order at specific doping levels, offering a purely electrical method to distinguish distinct altermagnetic orders. Our results position hybrid altermagnets as a promising platform for controllable nonlinear transport and spintronic applications.},

We focus on three of them, namely: (i) a non-unitary superconductor with different spatial anisotropies for the spin-up and spin-down condensates, (ii) a half-and-half metal-superconductor where only electrons with one of the two spin components form Cooper pairs, and (iii) a spin chiral superconductor with spin-polarized edge states. Interestingly, the first of these three superconductors exhibits an unusual fractional ac Josephson current for only one of the two spin polarizations. We present phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theories for these unconventional superconductors and show that they correspond to stable minima of the free energies.

Here, we address this question and show that a weakly-dispersing dynamics of a localized wavepacket in phase space leaves a "quantum trail" on the eigenstates, that is, makes them vary slowly when moving along a trajectories in phase space, even if not periodic. The quantum trails underpin a remarkable dynamical effect: for a system initialized in a localized wavepacket, the long-time phase-space distribution is enhanced along the short-time trajectory, which can result in ergodicity breaking. We provide the general intuition for these effects and prove them in the stadium billiard, for which an unwarping procedure allows to visualize the phase space on the two-dimensional space of the page.},

Altermagnetism exhibits total net magnetization zero and symmetry-induced spin splitting, which separating it in contrast to both antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetism. This review discusses the theory of altermagnetism including core symmetry mechanism and first principle approaches in theoretical models. Material candidates (e.g. MnTe, Mn{$_5$}Si{$_3$}, RuO{$_2$}, CrSb etc.) and predictions for altermagnetism were demonstrated through criteria for identifying altermagnetic materials, role of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in this discovery, and databases with high-throughput screening efforts. The experimental realization and characterization were discussed via techniques for detecting altermagnetic order (e.g., angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), neutron scattering, transport), challenges in confirming altermagnetism, and case studies of experimental breakthroughs. A comprehensive functional properties and device applications were described with the help of anomalous Hall effect without net magnetization, spin transport, spin torque, and spin filtering in altermagnets including integration with ferroelectrics, superconductors, and topological materials. A comparison of altermagnetism was illustrated with antiferromagnetism, spin glasses, and topological magnetic phases. The role of computational tools was highlighted by AI-driven materials discovery, inverse design approaches, and data-driven modelling of magnetic behaviour. Some of the significant headwinds were underlined by demonstrating stability and tunability of altermagnetic states, precise detection and control, need for experimental benchmarks, and integration into real-world devices. At the end outlook and future directions were deliberated about, with opportunities for interdisciplinary research, advances in instrumentation and computation, and the roadmap toward altermagnetic-based spintronic platforms.},

  abstract = {The erratic nature of chaotic behavior is thought to erode the stability of periodic behavior, including topological oscillations. However, we discover that in the presence of chaos, non-trivial topology not only endures but also provides robust protection to chaotic dynamics within a topological lattice hosting non-linear oscillators. Despite the difficulty in defining topological invariants in non-linear settings, non-trivial topological robustness still persists in the parametric state of chaotic boundary oscillations. We demonstrate this interplay between chaos and topology by incorporating chaotic Chua's circuits into a topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit. By extrapolating from the linear limit to deep into the non-linear regime, we find that distinctive correlations in the bulk and edge scroll dynamics effectively capture the topological origin of the protected chaos. Our findings suggest that topologically protected chaos can be robustly achieved across a broad spectrum of periodically-driven systems, thereby offering new avenues for the design of resilient and adaptable non-linear networks.},

However, their magnonic transport properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we develop a quantum-kinetic theory for thermally driven magnon currents that cleanly separates Berry-curvature-driven intrinsic contributions from Drude-like scattering-dependent terms. Applying this framework to a collinear honeycomb antiferromagnet with anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we reveal spin-split magnon bands that support both intrinsic and extrinsic spin Nernst and Seebeck currents. For realistic parameters, we predict a sizable magnon spin-splitting angle (about 3.3 degrees) and a pure transverse spin current capable of exerting a strong spin-splitter torque suitable for magnetization switching.},

Furthermore, we calculate the bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponents to study the chaotic behavior of an antiferromagnetic domain wall.

In contrast to the previous proposals of magnetic-soliton-based chaotic oscillators, the chaos of our ferrimagnetic skyrmion is driven solely by a constant current, instead of a time-dependent one. The occurrence of the chaotic oscillation is found to benefit from the strong nonlinearity of the magnetization dynamics in a ferrimagnet with a relatively weak antiferromagnetic exchange coupling and a low magnetic damping.

We investigate the supercurrent properties and discover non-reciprocal supercurrents for both the Fulde-Ferrell and Fulde-Ferrell* states with distinct spatial dependencies.

We here consider the contact between an altermagnet and a superconductor and determine how the altermagnetism affects the fundamental process of Andreev reflection. We show that the resulting charge conductance depends strongly on the interfacial orientation of the altermagnet relative to the superconductor, displaying features similar to normal metals or ferromagnets. The zero-bias conductance peak present at the interface in the \$d\$-wave case are robust toward the presence of an altermagnetic interaction. Moreover, the spin conductance strongly depends on the orientation of the altermagnet relative the interface. These results show how the anisotropic altermagnetic state can be probed by conductance spectroscopy and how it offers voltage control over charge and spin currents that are modulated due to superconductivity.},

First-principles calculations reveal SML excitons with binding energies exceeding 1400 meV in monolayers and 430 meV in their van der Waals heterobilayers, along with stacking-dependent optical selection rules for tunable interlayer excitons. These remarkable physical properties, combined with their long radiative lifetimes, strongly suggest the feasibility of SML excitons with robust spin-polarization at room temperature.

Here, we demonstrate that graphene can host all non-relativistic magnetic phases-namely, diamagnetism, paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, altermagnetism and fully compensated ferrimagnetism -- by using single hydrogen atoms as building blocks. Through precise manipulation of these atoms by scanning tunneling microscopy, we can experimentally create all such magnetic phases. Their different magnetic character is confirmed by density functional theory and mean-field Hubbard calculations. In particular, we show that the new magnetic paradigm known as altermagnetism can be realized, exhibiting directionally spin-split energy bands coexisting with zero net magnetization due to protecting spatial symmetries. It is furthermore possible to create fully compensated ferrimagnets, lacking these symmetries and therefore presenting unrestricted spin splitting of the bands, with a vanishing net magnetization which in this case is protected by Lieb's theorem. These findings put forward H-functionalized graphene as a versatile platform to design, build and study these new emergent magnetic phases at the atomic scale.},

  abstract = {Current studies of non-reciprocal superconducting (SC) transport have centered on the forward-backward asymmetry of the critical current measured along a single axis. In most realizations, this diode effect is achieved via introducing ferromagnetism or applying an external magnetic field, which drives system into an effective Fulde-Ferrell (FF) state but often at the cost of severely suppressing the SC gap and thus compromising device robustness. Here we propose and theoretically demonstrate that coupling a conventional \$s\$-wave SC thin film to a \$d\$-wave altermagnet offers a more resilient alternative. The momentum-dependent spin splitting inherent to altermagnets induces a non-collinear SC-diode effect in the BCS state, with the critical-current anisotropy exhibiting a fourfold (\$C\_4\$) symmetry. Upon entering the FF state at large splitting, this anisotropy gradually evolves into a unidirectional (\$C\_1\$) pattern. Crucially, the FF pairing momentum locks to the discrete crystal axes, eliminating the rotational Goldstone mode and preserving a sizable SC gap without any abrupt or significant suppression. These combined features make the altermagnetic proximity an appealing platform to engineer symmetry-protected, energy-efficient and programmable SC diodes for next-generation electronic devices.},

  abstract = {Planar Josephson junctions are pivotal for engineering topological superconductivity, yet are severely hindered by orbital effects induced by in-plane magnetic fields. In this work, we introduce the generic topological altermagnetic Josephson junctions (TAJJs) by leveraging the intrinsic spin-polarized band splitting and zero net magnetization attributes of altermagnets. Our proposed TAJJs effectively mitigate the detrimental orbital effects while robustly hosting Majorana end modes (MEMs) at both ends of the junction. Specifically, we demonstrate that MEMs emerge in \$d\_\{x{\textasciicircum}2-y{\textasciicircum}2\}\$-wave TAJJs but vanish in the \$d\_\{xy\}\$-wave configuration, thereby establishing the crystallographic orientation angle \${\textbackslash}theta\$ of the altermagnet as a novel control parameter of topology. The distinct spin-polarization of the MEMs provides an unambiguous experimental signature for the spin-resolved measurement. Furthermore, by harnessing the synergy between the \$d\_\{x{\textasciicircum}2-y{\textasciicircum}2\}\$-wave altermagnet and its superconducting counterpart, our proposal extends to high-\$T\_c\$ platforms naturally.

  abstract = {In conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) typically increases with barrier thickness as electron transmission in the antiparallel configuration decays faster than that of the parallel configuration. In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches form a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomena is explained by adouble-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O-based AMTJ, where the TMR anomalously decreases from 220\% to 40\% as the layer number of Cr2Se2O increases from 1 to 5. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit.},

  abstract = {Magnons with momentum-dependent chirality are a key signature of altermagnets. We identify bicircular light as a smoking-gun optical probe for chiral altermagnetic magnons, selectively targeting their quantum geometry induced by an alteration of magnonic chirality. We show that in \$d\$-wave altermagnets, under a canting magnetic field, the altermagnetic magnons realize a nontrivial quantum geometry, resulting in an enhancement of the nonlinear second-order light-magnon interactions. We find that the scattering of bicircular pulses probes the present magnon quantum geometry, even if the magnonic topology is trivial. Hence, our findings establish bicircular Raman response as an optical effect of choice to identify altermagnetic magnons. As such, we propose a universal experimental protocol to distinguish altermagnets from antiferromagnets by detecting their magnon chirality patterns with light, independently of the underlying magnon topology.},

  abstract = {Borides are a rich material family. To push the boundaries of borides' properties and applications into broader fields, we have conducted systematic theoretical and experimental searches for synthesizable phases in ternary borides TM{$_2$}B{$_2$} (T = 3d, M = 4d/5d transition metals). We find that TM{$_2$}B{$_2$} in the FeMo{$_2$}B{$_2$}-type and CoW{$_2$}B{$_2$}-type structures form a large family of stable/metastable materials of 120 members. Among them, we identify 40 materials with stable magnetic solutions. Further, we discover 11 altermagnets in the FeMo{$_2$}B{$_2$}-type structure. So far, boride altermagnets are rare. In these altermagnets, T = Fe or Mn atoms are arranged in parallel T-chains with strong ferromagnetic intrachain couplings and antiferromagnetic interchain couplings. They simultaneously exhibit electronic band spin splitting, typical of ferromagnetism, and zero net magnetization, typical of antiferromagnetism. They also exhibit magnonic band chiral splitting. Both effects originate from the unique altermagnetic symmetries crucially constrained by the nonmagnetic atoms in the structure. Transport properties of relevance to spintronic applications, including the strain-induced spin-splitter effect and anomalous Hall effect, are predicted. An iodine-assisted synthesis method for TM{$_2$}B{$_2$} is developed, using which 7 of the predicted low-energy phases are experimentally synthesized and characterized, including 4 altermagnets. This work expands the realm of borides by offering new opportunities for studying altermagnetism and altermagnons in borides. It also provides valuable insights into the discovery and design of altermagnets. By demonstrating that altermagnets can exist as families sharing a common motif, this work paves a feasible route for discovering altermagnets by elemental substitutions and high-throughput computations., rating = 0.0,},

  abstract = {Unconventional antiferromagnets with spin-split bands, such as noncollinear magnets and the recently discovered altermagnets, serve as new constituents to explore unconventional superconductivity. Here, we unveil a new type and previously unappreciated nature of spin-valley locking in noncollinear antiferromagnets and exploit this texture to achieve pure spin-triplet superconductivity. Using chiral antiferromagnetic kagome lattices (e.g., Mn\$\_3\$Ge and Mn\$\_3\$Ga) coupled to conventional \$s\$-wave superconductors as prototypical examples, we demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic chirality strongly favors spin-triplet pairing via superconducting proximity effect, while suppressing spin-singlet pairing in the antiferromagnets away from the interfaces. Crucially, such a long-sought spin-triplet superconducting state is established without invoking the prevailing mechanism of spin-orbit coupling or net magnetization. Furthermore, the spin-triplet supercurrent is resilient to both in-plane and out-of-plane Zeeman fields, which exhibits distinct superiority to Ising superconductivity, serving as a compelling experimental signature of the triplet pairing and spin-valley-locked texture.},

Addressing the scarcity of conductive altermagnets, we propose strain engineering as a reliable method for inducing altermagnetism. Focusing on rutile-structured \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{OsO\}\_2\$, first-principles calculations show that minor equibiaxial tensile strain (\${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ts\}\}\$=3{\textbackslash}\%) induces nonmagnetic-to-altermagnetic transitions, achieving an ASSE-driven spin-charge conversion ratio (\${\textbackslash}theta\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{AS\}\}\$) of \${\textbackslash}sim\$7{\textbackslash}\% -- far surpassing conventional spin Hall angles (\${\textbackslash}theta\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{IS\}\}\$). Calculations reveal that substantial \${\textbackslash}theta\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{AS\}\}\$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to nonrelativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirms the strain-induced ASSE's nonrelativistic origin. Further investigation reveals that \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{RuO\}\_2\$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties.

  abstract = {The control of unconventional magnetism, which displays an antiferromagnetic configuration with ferromagnetism-like properties, has drawn intense attention for advancing antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, through symmetry analysis, we propose a general stacking rule, characterized by a connection operator linking two stacked bilayers, for controlling unconventional magnetism via sliding ferroelectricity. Such rule enables the simultaneous switching of both electric polarization and nonrelativistic spin splitting or anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets, a class of collinear unconventional magnets. By comprehensively surveying the 80 layer groups, we identify all the stacking orders that allow for such two types of simultaneous switching. Combined with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the sliding ferroelectric control of spin polarization and anomalous Hall effect in the altermagnetic AgF2 bilayer. Our work provides a symmetry strategy for achieving ferroelectric control of unconventional magnetism in bilayer systems and opens avenues for exploring new types of magnetoelectric coupling.},
